People's views and opinions published on social media are indicative of their personality and their worldview. We are unaware of how others may respond to the thoughts we communicate. As a result of social media users distributing false information, various poor judgments may be made. Before these postings may be published, it is necessary to ascertain the sentiments and ideas underlying them. Sentiment Analysis is a method that may be used to circumvent this difficulty and provide a clearer picture of what an individual will post on social media. Sentiment analysis is the examination of sentiment (positive or negative) in the form of perspectives, ideas, emotions, and evaluations. In the field of text mining, sentiment analysis is an active area of study. One of the many approaches and difficulties that have arisen in this field to date is the categorization of emotion in a given text. The extraction of the sentiment-specific paraphrase from the text body. This study demonstrates that artificial neural networks may be used to extract sentiment from a dataset of financial tweets by preparing the dataset for use in neural network models and executing the models. ANN and Machine learning models based on Nave Bayes will be utilised. Neuronal network that replicates Convolution-based neural networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is Long Short-Term Memory is widely used for this application. CNN-LSTM is an effective algorithm for machine learning. The outcomes of these models will be presented in our concluding report, which will bring everything to a close. The dataset consists of text data and the labels of the text data.  The text data is the financial news headlines from the perspective of a retail investor.
